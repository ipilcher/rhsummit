## Lab 0: Introduction

Thank you for joining us at Red Hat Summit 2018, and welcome to this afternoon's
hands-on lab - **Understanding Containerized Red Hat OpenStack Platform**.

In this lab, we will be taking an in-depth look at the latest release of Red
Hat OpenStack Platform, OSP 12 (which is based on the upstream OpenStack Pike
release).  In particular, we will be looking at OSP 12's implementation of
containerized OpenStack and infrastructure services.

This is an intermediate-to-advanced lab.  It is not an introduction to OpenStack,
Red Hat OpenStack Platform, or OSP director/TripleO.  (If you're interested in
learning about OSP director, we recommend attending **Hands on with Red Hat
OpenStack Platform director** (L1010) at this time tomorrow.)
