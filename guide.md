## Lab 0: Introduction

Thank you for joining us at Red Hat Summit 2018, and welcome to this afternoon's
hands-on lab - **Understanding Containerized Red Hat OpenStack Platform**.

In this lab, we will be taking an in-depth look at the latest release of Red
Hat OpenStack Platform, OSP 12 (which is based on the upstream OpenStack Pike
release).  In particular, we will be looking at OSP 12's implementation of
containerized OpenStack and infrastructure services and how containerization
affects tasks such as deployment, updates, monitoring, troubleshooting, etc.

This is an intermediate-to-advanced lab.  It is not an introduction to Linux
containers, OpenStack, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, or OSP director/TripleO.
This doesn't mean that you need to be an expert with these technologies, but we
simply don't have time to talk about them individually in any depth.  (If you're
interested in learning more about OSP director, we recommend attending **Hands
on with Red Hat OpenStack Platform director** (L1010) at this time tomorrow.)

We have a number of Red Hat OpenStack subject matter experts in the room with us
today.  If you have any problems or questions, please raise your hand, and one
of them will be with you as soon as possible.

### OpenStack and Containers

Having written that we're not going to talk about containers, we're now going to
talk about containers, but only a few aspects that are relevant to Red Hat
OpenStack Platform 12.

**We are not talking about running containerized applications on OpenStack.**
OpenStack is a fantastic platform for running containerized applications and
container orchestration engines, such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform,
but that is not the subject of this lab.
 
Instead, this lab is concerned with running the services that manage an
OpenStack environment within containers.  Why is Red Hat doing this?

Running OpenStack (and other) services within containers provides a number of
benefits.

* **Stability** &mdash; Each container runs as an independent stack, with no
  dependencies on other containers.
* **Security** &mdash; Applications running within containers are isolated from the
  host operating system and each other.  Because container images are immutable,
  any compromise is contained, and containers can easily be recreated from
  sources.
* **Lifecycle management** &mdash; Because containers are isolated, atomic units, each
  containerized service can be updated independently.  Unlike package-based
  deployments, containerized services can be updated without breaking shared
  library dependencies.
* **Flexibility** &mdash; Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduced the concept of
  composable service roles.  Rather than offering only a handful of monolithic
  roles with pre-defined services (such as the controller and compute roles),
  OSP 10 and later allow administrators to create roles with their own unique
  combinations of services.  Containerization eases the deployment of these
  custom service combinations.
* **Control** &mdash; Resource consumption can be limited at the container level,
  ensuring that a rogue service does not starve other services of resources.
  Architectures such as Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure for Cloud could
  not be reliably deployed without this control.

Note that there are a few ways in which the services in Red Hat OpenStack
platform don't fit the traditional containerized application model.

* **Networking** &mdash; Red Hat OpenStack Platform has supported network isolation -
  separating OpenStack and workload traffic onto multiple physical networks -
  since its very first release.  Container runtimes and orchestrators, however,
  tend to be optimized for services that each have a single IP address on a
  single flat network.  To accomodate OSP's requirement for multiple networks,
  all containers in OSP 12 run with ``host`` networking, where all host network
  interfaces, IP addresses, etc., are exposed to the containerized applications.
* **Configuration** &mdash; OSP 12 is the sixth version of Red Hat OpenStack Platform
  to use OSP director (TripleO) for installation and configuration.  Over those
  six releases, OSP director has developed a robust system for creating and
  customizing OpenStack (and other) configuration files - including support for
  site-specific customizations and a large ecosystem of partner plug-ins.  A
  later lab will explore how OSP 12 preserves compatibility with customer
  configurations and partner-plugins - including compatibility across upgrades
  from non-containerized OSP 11 to containerized OSP 12!
* **Logging** &mdash; Just like OpenStack services expect to read their configuration
  from local configuration files, they expect to write their logs to local log
  files.  OSP 12 makes these log files visible to the host operating system,
  although their locations differ from those of the non-containerized services
  in OSP 11.  (A later lab will provide details.)  Tools that parse these log
  files will need to be updated for OSP 12.
* **Privileged operations** &mdash; Isolation from the host operating system is one of
  the benefits of containerizing applications, but there are certain services
  within OSP that require privileged access to the host OS.  For example,
  libvirt interacts with KVM to manage virtual machines, and Neutron creates
  and destroys network namespaces and Open vSwitch bridges and ports.  For this
  reason, a few containers within OSP 12 run as ``privileged`` containers.

### TripleO Terminology

![TripleO](/images/overcloud-undercloud.png)

OpenStack Platform director (OSP director) is based on the upstream TripleO
project.  TripleO stands for "OpenStack on OpenStack," but what does this mean?

We often talk about instances (usually virtual machines) running "on" a
particular cloud or infrastructure, such as OpenStack &mdash; meaning that that
infrastructure is responsible for deploying, managing, metering, and ultimately
retiring the instance.  In addition to traditional virtual machine instances,
OpenStack supports bare-metal instances via a service called **Ironic**.  Thus,
it is possible to run a bare-metal server "on" an OpenStack cloud, and we use
this capability to deploy and manage Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

This brings us to two very important terms, that will be used throughout this
lab.

* **Undercloud** &mdash; The undercloud (sometimes refered to as the OSP director
  node) is an "all-in-one" OpenStack deployment that deploys, configures, and
  manages a set of bare-metal servers which run Red Hat OpenStack Platform.
* **Overcloud** &mdash; The OSP servers managed by the undercloud are refered to as
  the overcloud, because they run "on top of" the undercloud.

OpenStack on OpenStack!

## Lab 1: Lab Environment

This lab features a realistic OSP 12 deployment (except for the number of
compute nodes), including:

* A highly available OpenStack control plane
* Isolated networks (VLANs) for
  * internal control plane &mdash; APIs, messaging, database, etc.
  * storage and storage management
  * external API/tenant access (floating IPs)
* Pre-determined IP addresses
* Bonded network interfaces
* Red Hat Ceph Storage

This environment runs as a set of virtual machines in the Ravello cloud, which
allows us to simulate much of the network infrastructure (NICs, switches, VLANs)
found in real datacenters.  Red Hat has developed an IPMI "bridge," which maps
IPMI commands to Ravello API calls, allowing us to use standard power control
agents.  Finally, it also supports nested virtualization, which allows our
compute node VM(s) to run KVM guests themselves.

You will access your personal lab environment via a bastion VM.  To log in to
the bastion, ...

The bastion also acts as an NTP server, yum repository server, and container
image registry for your environment.

**Networks**

![Lab networks](/images/lab-networks.svg)

Because we're using pre-determined IP addresses, we already know what our
overcloud nodes' addresses will be on these networks.  (The exceptions are the
provisioning network addresses, which are always dynamically assigned.  We
happen to be sharing that network with our IPMI BMCs, so we actually have a mix
of static and dynamic addresses on the same network.)

Deploying this OSP 12 architecture into the Ravello environment takes at least
60 minutes, and we don't want to spend half of our time just watching a
deployment.  So we'll start with a fully deployed environment in which we can
do som exploration and testing.  As a final step, we'll delete the overcloud and
look at the deployment process.

## Lab 2: Looking Around

In this lab, we'll examine our containerized OSP 12 deployment.

First, log in to the undercloud.  (Enter ``redhat`` as the password.)

```
[lab-user@bastion-XXXX ~]$ ssh stack@undercloud.example.com
The authenticity of host 'undercloud.example.com (192.168.122.253)' can't be established.

```

### Is This Thing On?

Before doing anything else, let's check that our deployment is working properly.
(It was just powered on for the first time in several weeks.)

Source the ``stackrc`` file to access OpenStack services on the undercloud.

```
[stack@undercloud ~]$ . stackrc
(undercloud) [stack@undercloud ~]$
```

Check the status of our overcloud nodes.  (Remember that these nodes are
managed by the Ironic service on the **undercloud**.)

Please let one of the instructors know if any of your nodes show ``None`` in the
power state column or ``True`` in the maintenance column.

```

+--------------------------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------+
```

Now list look at the overcloud hosts.  From the undercloud's point of view,
these are **instances** that run on the bare-metal nodes.  (The instance IDs can
be used to map the instances to their bare-metal nodes.)

```

+--------------------------------------+------------------+--------+----------------------+----------------+--------------+
```

Check the status of the Ceph storage cluster.  (The clock skew and "too many PGs
per OSD" warnings are expected.  Let an instructor know if you see any other
warnings or errors.)

```
(undercloud) [stack@undercloud ~]$ ssh heat-admin@172.16.0.32 sudo ceph -s

```

A number of items have been pre-created in the **overcloud**.

* ``external`` network and subnet
* ``m1.tiny`` instance flavor
* ``cirros-0.3.4-x86_64`` image
* ``test`` tenant and user
* ``test`` network, subnet, and router
* ``stack`` SSH keypair
* ``test1`` instance

Source the ``testrc`` file to access the overcloud as the ``test`` user.

```                 
(undercloud) [stack@undercloud ~]$ . testrc
(test@overcloud) [stack@undercloud ~]$
```

Check the status of the instance.  It should be ``SHUTOFF``.

```
(test@overcloud) [stack@undercloud ~]$ openstack server list

### Containers (Three Different Ones)

Now that we've verified that we have a working OSP deployment, let's take a look
at the running containers that make it work, starting on one of the controllers.

There are 49 separate containers running on our controller.  They can be roughly
divided into three different varieties:

1. Pacemaker-managed containers,
1. Ceph containers, and
1. Everything else.

#### Pacemaker-Managed Containers

Pacemaker has long been used as the high-availability infrastructure in Red Hat
OpenStack Platform.  In versions prior to OSP 12, Pacemaker managed key
infrastructure services on which OpenStack depends; in OSP 12, Pacemaker is
managing **exactly the same set of services**, but almost all of them are now
running as containers.

(In fact, one of the key things to understand about the containerized services
in OSP 12 is that the overall architecture is **exactly the same** as
non-containerized OSP 11.  Services all run in exactly the same place - as
determined by the standard/customer roles; they are just running as
containers, rather than traditional services.)

Let's look at our Pacemaker cluster.

Daemon Status:
  corosync: active/enabled
  pacemaker: active/enabled
  pcsd: active/enabled
```

This shows us several different resource types.

1. IP addresses &mdash; Just like earlier releases, Pacemaker manages a virtual IP
   address on each network.  HAProxy listens on these VIPs and distributes
   work across the controllers.

2. ``openstack-cinder-volume`` &mdash; Our old friend, the Cinder volume service, is
   still running in active/passive mode, so we need Pacemaker to ensure that
   **exactly** one instance is running at any particular time.
   
   Cinder volume defaults to running as a traditional, non-containerized service
   in OSP 12 (although a containerized version is included as a tech preview).
   This was done because this service often makes use of storage-specific
   plugins, which must be built into the container image.  Neutron services are
   non-containerized in OSP 12 for the same reason (and also available in
   containerized versions as a tech preview).  Red Hat plans to containierize
   both the Cinder volume and Neutron services in OSP 13.

3. Docker container sets &mdash; We can see 4 Docker container "bundles" being
   managed by Pacemaker &mdash; ``rabbitmq``, ``galera``, ``redis``, and ``haproxy``.

Bundles are a new Pacemaker resource type that define how Pacemaker should run
a container.  For example:

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo pcs resource show haproxy-bundle
 Bundle: haproxy-bundle
  Docker: image=172.16.0.1:8787/rhosp12/openstack-haproxy:pcmklatest network=host options="--user=root --log-driver=journald -e KOLLA_CONFIG_STRATEGY=COPY_ALWAYS" replicas=3 run-command="/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/kolla_start"
  Storage Mapping:
   options=ro source-dir=/var/lib/kolla/config_files/haproxy.json target-dir=/var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json (haproxy-cfg-files)
   options=ro source-dir=/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/haproxy/ target-dir=/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src (haproxy-cfg-data)
   options=ro source-dir=/etc/hosts target-dir=/etc/hosts (haproxy-hosts)
   options=ro source-dir=/etc/localtime target-dir=/etc/localtime (haproxy-localtime)
   options=ro source-dir=/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted target-dir=/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted (haproxy-pki-extracted)
   options=ro source-dir=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt target-dir=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt (haproxy-pki-ca-bundle-crt)
   options=ro source-dir=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt target-dir=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt (haproxy-pki-ca-bundle-trust-crt)
   options=ro source-dir=/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem target-dir=/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem (haproxy-pki-cert)
   options=rw source-dir=/dev/log target-dir=/dev/log (haproxy-dev-log)
   options=ro source-dir=/etc/pki/tls/private/overcloud_endpoint.pem target-dir=/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src-tls/etc/pki/tls/private/overcloud_endpoint.pem (haproxy-cert)
```

You can see that this defines things like:

* The image used to run the container,
* The network type to use (``host`` as always)
* The number of replicas that Pacemaker should run
* The command to run within the container
* Host directories that are bind mounted (mostly read-only) into the container

We can use the ``docker inspect`` command to see how these settings have been
applied to the running container.  (``docker inspect`` outputs a large amount of
JSON, so we'll use the ``jq`` command to see the parts in which we're
interested, but it can be instructive to look through the complete output.)

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect haproxy-bundle-docker-0 | jq .[0].Config.Image
"172.16.0.1:8787/rhosp12/openstack-haproxy:pcmklatest"

[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect haproxy-bundle-docker-0 | jq .[0].HostConfig.NetworkMode
"host"

[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect haproxy-bundle-docker-0 | jq .[0].Config.Cmd
[
  "/bin/bash",
  "/usr/local/bin/kolla_start"
]

[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect haproxy-bundle-docker-0 | jq .[0].HostConfig.Binds
[
  "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:ro",
  "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:ro",
  "/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:ro",
  "/var/lib/kolla/config_files/haproxy.json:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json:ro",
  "/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/haproxy/:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src:ro",
  "/etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro",
  "/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:ro",
  "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro",
  "/dev/log:/dev/log:rw",
  "/etc/pki/tls/private/overcloud_endpoint.pem:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src-tls/etc/pki/tls/private/overcloud_endpoint.pem:ro"
]
```

One final item, which is true of all Pacemaker-managed containers.

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect haproxy-bundle-docker-0 | jq .[0].HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name
"no"
```

If one of the Pacemaker-managed containers dies for some reason, we don't want
the ``docker`` daemon to automatically restart it; we always want these
containers to be completely managed by Pacemaker.

#### Ceph Containers

The second variety of container in our deployment is a Ceph container.  Each of
our controllers has a Ceph monitor container running and each Ceph storage node
has 2 Ceph OSD containers running (one for each data disk).

Ceph containers are different from "normal" containers (discussed below),
mainly in the way that they are deployed and configured.  Starting with OSP 12,
OSP director deploys Ceph containers with ``ceph-ansible`` &mdash; the same
mechanism that is used for standalone Ceph installations.  This will be
discussed further in the **Deployment** lab below.

One thing which is significant is the startup mechanism for the Ceph containers,
so let's take a look.

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect ceph-mon-lab-controller01 |  jq .[0].HostConfig.RestartPolicy
{
  "MaximumRetryCount": 0,                                                                                                                                                                                          
  "Name": "no"
}
```

So Docker hasn't been configured to automatically start these containers.  How
are they started?

The answer is ``systemd``.  ``ceph-ansible`` creates a ``systemd`` service for
each container that it wishes to run.

#### Everything Else

The remainder of the containers running on our controllers are what we will call
"normal" containers (for lack of a better term).  These containers are set to be
automatically started by the Docker daemon.

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect memcached | jq .[0].HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name
"always"
```

### The Ananatomy of a Container

Let's take a detailed look at one of our running containers, to understand how
it's been configured to run an OpenStack service.

First, let's look at the full output of ``docker inspect``.

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker inspect nova_scheduler | less
(...)
        "Path": "kolla_start",
(...)
            "Binds": [
                "/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:ro",
                "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:ro",
                "/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:ro",
                "/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts:/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts:ro",
                "/var/lib/kolla/config_files/nova_scheduler.json:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json:ro",
                "/var/log/containers/nova:/var/log/nova",
                "/etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro",
                "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro",
                "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:ro",
                "/dev/log:/dev/log",
                "/etc/puppet:/etc/puppet:ro",
                "/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src:ro",
                "/run:/run"
            ],
(...)
            "User": "nova",
(...)
            "Env": [
                "KOLLA_CONFIG_STRATEGY=COPY_ALWAYS",
(...)
```

We've copied a few of the more significant bits of output from this command
above.

#### Let Me Out! Let Me Out!

Thus far, we've done all of our investigation from our controller's host
operating system &mdash; effectively examining containers from the outside.
Let's get an "inside" view.

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker exec -it nova_scheduler /bin/sh
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$
```

Note that our containerized shell is running as the ``nova`` user.  This matches
the user setting of the container that we saw with ``docker inspect``.

Let's see what is running in the container.

```
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ ps aux
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
nova           1  0.1  0.7 273240 96276 ?        Ss   19:11   0:10 /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/nova-scheduler
nova        1375  0.0  0.0  11776  1748 ?        Ss   20:37   0:00 /bin/sh
nova        1525  0.0  0.0  47448  1664 ?        R+   20:44   0:00 ps aux
```

Not much!  Other than our shell and ``ps`` command, only the ``nova-scheduler``
process is running.

What about networking?

```

    link/ether 02:42:e6:c0:ac:7e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

That's ``host`` networking in action.  All of the host's network interfaces,
IP addresses, routing tables, and firewall rules are visible within the
container.  (Actually, that's only true of network objects in the host's default
network namespace.  Interfaces, etc., in other network namespaces &mdash; such
as Neutron's ``qdhcp-...`` and ``qrouter-...`` namespaces are inaccessible from
within the container.)

#### Logging

Now let's look at logging.  OpenStack Nova services generally write their logs
to files in ``/var/log/nova``, so let's look at that directory.

```
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ ls -l /var/log/nova
total 52532
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova  4324332 Apr 17 21:01 nova-api-metadata.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova 10835400 Apr 13 12:00 nova-api-metadata.log.1
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova 10340388 Apr 17 21:01 nova-api.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova 10491224 Apr 13 11:00 nova-api.log.1
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova 10539568 Apr 13 04:00 nova-api.log.2
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova    29890 Apr 17 19:12 nova-conductor.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova    16783 Apr 17 19:12 nova-consoleauth.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova    75225 Apr 12 20:46 nova-manage.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova     1776 Apr 17 19:06 nova-novncproxy.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova   699968 Apr 17 21:01 nova-placement-api.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova        0 Apr 13 00:01 nova-rowsflush.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 nova nova   151254 Apr 17 21:00 nova-scheduler.log
```

We can see logs for all of the Nova services in that directory, but we know that
only ``nova-scheduler`` is running in this container.  What's going on?

Recall the ``Binds`` stanza from the ``docker inspect`` output above:

```
"Binds": [
    "/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:ro",
    "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:ro",
    "/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:ro",
    "/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts:/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts:ro",
    "/var/lib/kolla/config_files/nova_scheduler.json:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json:ro",
    "/var/log/containers/nova:/var/log/nova",
    "/etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro",
    "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro",
    "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:ro",
    "/dev/log:/dev/log",
    "/etc/puppet:/etc/puppet:ro",
    "/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src:ro",
    "/run:/run"
],
```

Note that the host directory ``/var/log/containers/nova`` has been  **bind**
mounted into the container at ``/var/log/nova``.  (A bind mount creates an
alternative path to an existing directory or file, similar to a symbolic link.)
Note also that this particular bind does **not** end with ``:ro``; writing to a
log file obviously requires read/write access.

After looking at the contents of this directory, it isn't much of a stretch to
guess that the other Nova containers running on this host are also bind mounting
this directory (``/var/log/containers/nova``) &mdash; effectively sharing it.

Let's add an entry to the Nova scheduler log file.  Later, we'll verify that it
is visible from the host operating system.

```
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ echo 'This is not a dance!' >> /var/log/nova/nova-scheduler.log
```

#### Configuration Files

We might assume that configuration files would use an approach similar to that
of the log directories and simply bind mount configuration directories into our
container.  Looking back at the ``Binds`` stanza again, we can see that only a
few files and directories under ``/etc`` are bind mountes &mdash; a small subset
of the files in our container's ``/etc`` directory tree.  So how do the correct
versions of all those files get there?

To answer that question, we need to look at our container's startup process.  We
saw with ``docker inspect`` that our container's entry point is something called
``kolla_start``.  Let's look at that script.

```
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ which kolla_start
/usr/local/bin/kolla_start

()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ cat /usr/local/bin/kolla_start
#!/bin/bash
set -o errexit

# Processing /var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json as root.  This is necessary
# to permit certain files to be controlled by the root user which should
# not be writable by the dropped-privileged user, especially /run_command
sudo -E kolla_set_configs
CMD=$(cat /run_command)
ARGS=""

if [[ ! "${!KOLLA_SKIP_EXTEND_START[@]}" ]]; then
    # Run additional commands if present
    . kolla_extend_start
fi

echo "Running command: '${CMD}${ARGS:+ $ARGS}'"
exec ${CMD} ${ARGS}
```

The comment at the beginning of the script provides a good explanation of what
it's doing &mdash; run (as ``root``) the ``kolla_set_configs`` script and then
run the command specified in ``/run_command``.  Let's start at the end and check
the command that will be run:

```
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ cat /run_command && echo
/usr/bin/nova-scheduler
```

(Apparently cool kids don't use newlines.)

OK, that makes sense.  Once ``kolla_set_configs`` has done it's work, this
container (``nova_scheduler``) will run ``/usr/bin/nova-scheduler``.  Now let's
look at what ``kolla_set_configs`` is doing.

Rather than reading all 422 lines of ``/usr/local/bin/kolla_set_configs``, let's
look at the JSON file that tells it what to do (as noted in the comment above).
First, note that ``/var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json`` is bind mounted
from ``/var/lib/kolla/config_files/nova_scheduler.json``.  That naming
convention allows different ``config.json`` files, for different containers, to
coexist in the host's ``/var/lib/kolla/config_files`` directory.  What is
actually in that file?

```
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ cat /var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json
cat: /var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json: Permission denied
```

Oops.  Recall that ``kolla_start`` uses ``sudo`` to run ``kolla_set_configs``
with ``root`` privileges, and we're currently running as the ``nova`` user.
Let's exit our containerized shell, so that we can start a new one as ``root``.

```
()[nova@lab-controller01 /]$ exit
exit
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$
```

Before starting our new shell, let's check that our log entry is visible from
the host operating system.

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ grep dance /var/log/containers/nova/*
/var/log/containers/nova/nova-scheduler.log:This is not a dance!
```

Now that we've confirmed that, start the new shell.

```
[heat-admin@lab-controller01 ~]$ sudo docker exec -u root -it nova_scheduler /bin/sh
()[root@lab-controller01 /]$
```

Recall that ``kolla_start`` runs ``sudo -E kolla_set_configs``.  Let's look at
the rules that allow that.

```
()[root@lab-controller01 /]$ cat /etc/sudoers
# The idea here is a container service adds their UID to the kolla group
# via usermod -a -G kolla <uid>.  Then the kolla_start may run
# kolla_set_configs via sudo as the root user which is necessary to protect
# the immutability of the container

# anyone in the kolla group may sudo -E (set the environment)
Defaults: %kolla setenv

# root may run any commands via sudo as the network seervice user.  This is
# neededfor database migrations of existing services which have not been
# converted to run as a non-root user, but instead do that via sudo -E glance
root ALL=(ALL) ALL

# anyone in the kolla group may run /usr/local/bin/kolla_set_configs as the
# root user via sudo without password confirmation
%kolla ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/kolla_set_configs

#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
```

Now we can look at ``config.json``.  (``jq`` isn't available in the container,
so we'll use a Python module to format the JSON.)

```
()[root@lab-controller01 /]$ cat /var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json | python -m json.tool
{
    "command": "/usr/bin/nova-scheduler",
    "config_files": [
        {
            "dest": "/",
            "merge": true,
            "preserve_properties": true,
            "source": "/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src/*"
        }
    ],
    "permissions": [
        {
            "owner": "nova:nova",
            "path": "/var/log/nova",
            "recurse": true
        }
    ]
}
```

This is pretty straitforward.  ``kolla_set_configs`` is going to copy the
contents of ``/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src`` (which is a read-only bind mount
of ``/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova``) to the root directory of the
container, merging the two directory trees and preserving the properties of the
copied files (ownership, permissions, etc.).  It's also going to recursively
set the permissions of the ``/var/log/nova`` directory.

Why is the destination directory ``/``, rather than ``/etc``?  Let's look at the
files under ``/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src``.

```
()[root@lab-controller01 /]$ ls /var/lib/kolla/config_files/src
etc  var

()[root@lab-controller01 /]$ find /var/lib/kolla/config_files/src/var -type f
/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src/var/spool/cron/nova
/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src/var/www/cgi-bin/nova/nova-api
```

In addition to the expected files under ``/etc``, there are a couple of files
under ``/var`` that also need to be copied.  (This could likely have also been
accomplished by having two elements in the ``config_files`` array &mdash; one
for ``/etc`` and one for ``/var``.)

This approach gives our containerized application exactly what it expects
&mdash; a read/write set of configuration files (depending on file ownership and
permissions) &mdash; while keeping the container immutable.  If one of the
containerized services in OSP 12 were to be compromised and made to corrupt one
of it's configuration files, the configuration could be restored to the desired
state by simply restarting the container.

A final note about ``kolla_set_configs`` &mdash; All of its actions are logged
to ``stderr``/``stdout``, and they can be viewed with the ``docker logs``
command.

### Other Node Types

Thus far, we've only looked at one of our controller nodes.  Before moving on to
the next lab, let's take a quick look at our other two node types &mdash;
compute and Ceph storage.

#### Compute Nodes

First, log out of the controller and log in to the compute node.

```

As one might expect, we see a number of Nova compute and libvirt containers
running.  All of them are using ``kolla_start`` to set up their configuration
files.

Also as expected, the compute services make extensive use of privileged
containers to manage virtual machines.

```
[heat-admin@lab-compute01 ~]$ for TAINER in `sudo docker ps --format '{{ .Names }}'` ; do echo -n "${TAINER}:  " ; sudo docker inspect $TAINER | jq .[0].HostConfig.Privileged ; done
logrotate_crond:  true
nova_migration_target:  true
ceilometer_agent_compute:  false
nova_compute:  true
nova_libvirt:  true

#### Ceph Storage Nodes

Now let's look at the containers on one of our Ceph storage nodes.

```

We see that ``ceph-ansible`` has created a separate container for each Ceph OSD,
each of which corresponds to a single data disk.

And just like the Ceph monitor containers on our controllers, each of these
containers is a separate ``systemd`` unit, rather than being automatically
started by the Docker daemon.
